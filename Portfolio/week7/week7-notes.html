    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided</li>
        <li>Functions have built-in properties such as length , but can have custom properties added.</li>
        <li>All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an
            object that is provided as an argument.</li>
        <li>A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function.</li>
        <li>A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
        <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.</li>
        <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next
            value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>
        <li>The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client,
            such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the
            request and sends back a response to the client.</li>
        <li> Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. The resources requested
            are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather than a whole web page.</li>
        <li>Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used: Asynchronous
            JavaScript and XML</li>
        <li>Asynchronous:When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. It
            can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks to manage
            this, programs are able to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.</li>
        <li>JavaScript: was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax
            enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in
            real time.</li>
        <li>XML: When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. Many different
            types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, which is more
            lightweight and easier to parse than XML</li>
        <li>The text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a
            promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet. Once it has read
            the whole file, it returns a promise that resolves with a blob object.</li>
        <li> The json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that
            resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
        <li>HTTPheadersare used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. Typical information
            contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information, authentication information
            and when the resource was last modified.</li>
        <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own
            response objects.The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about
            the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
    </ul>
