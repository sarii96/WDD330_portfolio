    <ul>
        <li>client-side form validation: to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format.
            Also, it helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.
        </li>
        <li>client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure because client-side
            validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server.
        </li>
        <li>Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is
            called server-side validation.</li>
        <li>Three main reasons for the validation form: We want to get the right data, in the right format, We want to
            protect our users' data, and We want to protect ourselves. </li>
        <li>Different types of client-side validation: Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features,
            which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much
            JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable
            as JavaScript validation. JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely
            customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
        <li>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline,
            such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way
            to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</li>
        <li>The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in three main ways:<br>

            The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or
            500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network
            failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.<br>
            fetch() won't can receive cross-site cookies; you can’t can establish a cross site session using fetch.
            Set-Cookie headers from other sites are silently ignored.<br>
            fetch won’t send cookies, unless you set the credentials init option. (Since Aug 25, 2017. The spec changed
            the default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since 61.0b13.)</li>
        <li>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers()constructor.</li>
        <li> Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are resolved.<br>

            The most common response properties you'll use are:<br>

            Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code.<br>
            Response.statusText — A string (default value "OK"), which corresponds to the HTTP status code message.<br>
            Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299
            inclusive. This returns a Boolean.</li>
