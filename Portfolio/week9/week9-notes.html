    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
        <li>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</li>
        <li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is
            the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object.
        </li>
        <li>parseInt() and isNaN() , are actually methods of the global object.</li>
        <li>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator
            object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information
            about the browser and operating system being used</li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It
            contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.</li>
        <li>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http , https , pop2 , ftp etc.)
        </li>
        <li>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URLandthe port number .</li>
        <li>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</li>
        <li>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if
            the port is not explicitly stated </li>
        <li>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</li>
        <li>The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters.</li>
        <li>The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. </li>
        <li>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated
            from.</li>
        <li>The window.location object also has the following methods:The reload() method can be used to force a reload
            of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true , it will force the browser to reload the page from
            the server, instead of using a cached page.<br>
            The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter.<br>
            The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored
            in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.<br>
            The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:</li>
        <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
        <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
        <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be
            canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
        <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the
            clearInterval() method.</li>
        <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing
            the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.
        </li>
        <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but
            has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. </li>
        <li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user
            experience with JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the
            user gives permission.</li>
        <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to
            avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
        <li>The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They
                    also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way
            communication.</li>
        <li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>
