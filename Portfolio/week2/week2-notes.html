     <h2>Notes</h2>
    <li>There are two ways to write comment in javascript: // or /* */</li>
    <li>A JavaScript program is made up of a series of statements. Each statement ends with a new line or semicolon</li>
    <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and
        are listed below: String, Symbol4, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null. Any value that isnâ€™t one of the primitive data types listed above is an object. </li>
    
    <li>typeof for finding out the type of a value. Example:<br> 
        typeof 'hello'
       << 'string'
       <br> typeof 10
        << 'number'
        <br>typeof true
        << 'boolean'
       <br> typeof { ninja: 'turtle' }
        << 'object'
       <br> typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ]
        << 'object'
        </li>
        <li>Variables have to be declared before they can be useD, and for that we use "let" or "const".</li>
        <li>Scope:Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their
            value only exists inside the block they are declared in.There are two:global scope and loca scope.</li>
         <li>The slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an
                original array, starting at one position and finishing at another</li>
         </li>The splice() method removes items from an array then inserts new items in
         their place.</li>
         <li>A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code
            while a condition is still true.</li>
            <li>A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax</li>
            <li>Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to
                represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle
                difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is
                defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.
                </li>
                <li>Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are
                    hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked
                    until after they are defined.
                    </li>
                    <li>A callback is a function that is provided as an argument to another function.</li>
