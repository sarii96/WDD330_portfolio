    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
        </li>
        <li> Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a
            typo.</li>
        <li> User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the
            error. </li>
        <li> An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to
            the point where the error occurred.
            A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original
            function or method that started the sequence.
        </li>
        <li>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code
            will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</li>
        <li>Jestis a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy
            to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</li>
        <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs.
            Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>
        <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
    </ul>
