     <h2>Notes</h2>
     <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
     <p>
      - We should design fo the smallest, focus on the content and core functionality. That is the key to make a simple and beautiful app.<br>
      - The paradigm shift. People use more phones than computers. Moble traffic is up.<br>
      - Build for mobile first."Just because your website is responsive, it doesn't mean it's mobile first."<br>
      - Responsive Retrofitting: that's taking what you already have, and making it work on mobile. It is cheap, and prove a better experience.<br>
      - Mobile is not a fad.<br>
      - People use their THUMS to reach the phone. Reachability matters.<br>
      - Placement matters.<br>
      - Understanding matters.<br>
      - "The Hamburger" is not very useful.<br>
      - Reduce large information.<br>
      - Before adverstasing, research.<br>
      - No pop-up.<br>
